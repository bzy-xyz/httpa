Running the configs (cfg files) to get a small bamboo node running:
/home/YOURNAME/bamboo/bin/run-java bamboo.lss.DustDevil 3630.cfg &
/home/YOURNAME/bamboo/bin/run-java bamboo.lss.DustDevil 3633.cfg &
etc...
(allternatively, you can run this via screen)

Important:
When running a put or get operation on the DHT, if you are getting a connection refused error, make sure that in the cfg the nodeid and the gateway is set appropriately.
